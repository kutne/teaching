### COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course gives a broad overview of the history of the South Asian subcontinent from the start of the Mughal empire to its partitioning into India and Pakistan. Prominent themes in the course include shifting forms of governance, the emergence of religious and regional identities, social reform and the “woman question,” deindustrialization, and nationalism. Students will also learn about the practice of history more broadly, including how to read primary and secondary texts, how to weigh evidence, and how to formulate coherent historical arguments.

### WHAT YOU’LL LEARN  

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1.	_Demonstrate_ a basic chronological understanding of modern South Asian history from 1526-1947
2.	_Identify_ and _explain_ the key moments, actors, and groups in modern South Asian history that impacted the region’s social, cultural, and political trajectory. In other words, you will be able to write and speak clearly about major events in the past and explain why they are important;
3.	_Recognize_ history as an incomplete process – that is continually made and remade by humans for complex reasons – as a means to interpret the past.
4.	_Evaluate_ and _contextualize_ primary and secondary source materials in relation to their historical moment, the themes of course, and historiographical significance.

### WHAT WE’LL BE READING

We will primarily be reading from the following books: 

- Metcalf & Metcalf. _A Concise History of Modern India_. 
- McDermott et al. _Sources of Indian Traditions: Modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh_. 
- Khilnani. _Incarnations: A History of India in Fifty Lives_. 

Finally, you will receive three extremely brief reference items. They are overviews of the history of the three major religions that figure prominently in the modern history of this region: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. 

- Knott. _Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction_.
- Nesbitt. _Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction_.
- Silverstein. _Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction_.

While I will only assign readings from these texts sparingly, they will be essential resources you should reference throughout the term.

#### TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR WORK

Let’s talk about plagiarism. We often talk about it as an ethical question. Are you taking credit for someone else’s work? All submitted work must be original work written by you for this course. It must be original in form and content, with sources appropriately and accurately credited. Passing off someone else’s work as your own is a serious offense and will be reported. This includes using passages from the assigned readings without using quotation marks to mark them and omitting appropriate author name and page number.
