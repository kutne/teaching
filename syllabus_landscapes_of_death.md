# Hist 1200 Landscapes Of Death: Cemeteries, Massacres, & Memorial Sites     
[First-Year Writing Seminar](https://knight.as.cornell.edu/fws-guidelines)     
Spring 2020 | MWF 9:05-9:55 

### Course Description  
Why do we build memorials? Why is it important to remember the dead? From Civil War battlefields to Holocaust memorials, Arlington National Cemetery to roadside bouquets at accident sites, we physically and visually alter our landscape to commemorate the deceased. This course will examine how we memorialize the dead in the modern era, and the controversies that arise in the process. Students will develop close reading skills and written analysis of a wide array of source materials, including peer-reviewed scholarship, eye-witness accounts, fiction, historical records, and podcasts. They practice writing for multiple audiences, with an emphasis on unpacking academic concepts for non-specialist audiences.


### Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course you will demonstrate improved competency in the following skills:
- _Identifying_ a text’s target audience and argument, and articulating why argument and audience are significant;
- _Evaluating_ primary and secondary source materials;
- _Synthesizing_ information from multiple viewpoints and summarizing that information in your own words;
- _Outlining_, _drafting_, and _revising_ your own written work.

### Required Materials 
These are books we will be reading in their entirety. You may purchase them used or new at a bookstore or online, or borrow from the library. I have placed at least one copy of each book on reserve at the library. If you have any concerns about material costs, please come speak to me as soon as possible.

**Participation**: This is your single most important “civic responsibility” within the course. As a seminar, we are a community of individuals collectively pursuing intellectual growth. As such, each member of this scholarly community has a responsibility to themselves and the other members to complete all relevant assignments and to come to class meetings prepared to discuss the reading respectfully and honestly. The participation grade includes attendance, in-class activities, quizzes, rough drafts, and written homework.

**On Class Content & Conduct**: Given this course’s subject matter, we will often discuss difficult topics related to death and dying, including individual experiences with mourning, violence against marginalized communities, and genocide. Students should handle all course material with respect within the classroom and outside of it. Some of you may find these issues hit close to home. Some of you may not. Regardless, I ask that all students remember we are talking about real events and real people, many of whom were victims of violence.  

**Office Hours**: All students are required to visit my office hours at least once during the semester in addition to scheduled conferences. This is an opportunity for you to chat about whatever you like, whether it's related to the class or not. Bonus: I always have hot tea in my office.

#### What You'll be Writing
Assignment #1: 	Personal Reflection (2-4 pages)   
Assignment #2: 	Primary Source Analysis (3-4 pages)   
Assignment #3: 	Primary Source Analysis (4-5 pages)   
Assignment #4: 	Primary Source Analysis (5-6 pages)  
Assignment #5: 	Museum Exhibit Model & Exhibit Narrative (8-10 pages)

#### Guidelines For Submission Of Written Work
Every assignment, whether submitted online or in hard copy should include on the top of the first page: your name, the course, the date, and a title. You must come up with your own title for every writing assignment. For assignments that are multiple pages, ensure that your first initial and last name are on each page after the first.

**Formatting:**
- 12-pt font
- double-spaced
- Times New Roman
- 1-inch margins
- number all page 

**Late Policy**: Life happens. If you have concerns about making any course deadlines, please come speak to me as soon as possible. Timely submission of assignments is critical, especially during peer review or when you need feedback from me before you can complete the next assignment. With a few exceptions (which will be explicitly, such as peer review) each student may activate a 48-hour-no-questions-asked automatic extension up to three times over the course of the term. These extensions must be requested before the assignment deadline. You may not use multiple extensions on a single assignment.

**Citations**: When quoting another source or paraphrasing someone else’s ideas, provide footnotes and a bibliography using Chicago Style citations. We will spend some time on this in class, but in the meantime, you should consult [_The Chicago Manual of Style_](chicagomanualofstyle.org/) 17th edition (available via the library) and the [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html).

**The Public Domain**: All student writing for this course may be read and shared by all members of the class. This is an important aspect of the peer review process and required in this class. Exhibit models will be displayed in Olin Library.

### Course Access & Support
#### Electronic Devices
All students will sign a contract at the beginning of term in which they agree to responsible technology usage in the classroom. I recognize that students need access to technology in the classroom for many reasons, including but not limited to learning disabilities or chronic illness. I will not police how you use technology in the classroom so long as it is not disruptive to your peers. However, this also means that you must take responsibility for your own learning and decisions. Please see me in office hours if you have any concerns.

#### Accessibility Statement[^2] 
This course is intended for all Cornell students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If, at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome (and not required) to contact me by email or during office hours to discuss your specific needs. 
[^2]: Based on [disability statement by Zoë Wool at Rice University](https://anthrodendum.org/2018/08/13/check-your-syllabus-101-disability-access-statements/)

I also encourage you to contact the Student Disability Services Cornell Health Lvl 5, Ho Plaza (phone: 607-254-4545; email: sds_cu@cornell.edu). If you have a diagnosis, SDS can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through SDS, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.

#### Childcare in Class[^3] 
I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their baby and continuing their education. nursing babies are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.

In all cases where babies and children come to a face-to-face class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. I hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you strive for school-parenting balance. 

If you have care responsibilities not covered in the above policies, please let me know.

### The Cornell Writing Centers
The [Cornell Writing Centers](http://knight.as.cornell.edu/wc) (WC) provide support for individuals at any stage of the writing process. It is a free resource available to everyone on campus—faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students—for nearly any kind of writing project: applications, presentations, lab reports, essays, papers, and more. Tutors (trained undergraduate and graduate students) serve as responsive listeners and readers who can address questions about the writing process or about particular pieces of writing. They can also consider questions of confidence, critical reading, analytic thought, and imagination. Writing tutors also have experience working with English Language Learning writers. During the academic year, the WC are open Mondays-Thursdays, 3:30 – 5:30pm (Mann Library & Rockefeller Hall 178) and Sundays-Thursdays, 7:00 – 10:00pm (Olin library 403; Uris Library 108; Tatkon Center 3343 and Flora Rose 110). Writers can drop-in at a convenient time or [schedule a meeting online](http://knight.as.cornell.edu/wc).

### Academic Integrity
All submitted work must be original work written by you for this course and not another and must be original in form and content, with sources appropriately and accurately credited. If you have any questions about when or how to cite work not your own, please speak to me or a tutor at the Knight Institute. Passing off someone else’s work as your own is a serious offense and will be reported.

### Course Schedule
#### Planning the semester
The below schedule is tentative. It is very possible I will need to adjust the calendar slightly to foster a more effective learning environment. I will to announce any changes both in class and online. Additionally, I promise that nothing will be made due earlier than indicated but some things may be pushed back or eliminated altogether, depending on time available. 

For now, please look over the current plan and compare it with your other classes and commitments. Do you have three major papers due at the same time? Are you traveling for a tournament the same week as a big assignment? If so, come speak with me as soon as possible. Some things in life are unexpected, but you should come to me now if, for instance, you know now that you’ll be traveling for an athletic event or Model UN conference the same week as individual student conferences.

All items with an asterisk (*) are available on Canvas under Library Reserves. Any other supplementary readings will be in the appropriate week folder on Canvas.
